- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rob @CryptoHobbyist
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing an app that lets people calculate the conversion from over 200 fiat types to any Stellar token that the user chooses
- 
- This will be an app that will do the most important aspect of the future in crypto, MAKE IT SO PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE USING CRYPTO IN COMMERCE. 

This app will make it easy for anyone to calculate, using their native fiat, how much of a chosen crypto they want to give or receive in any transaction. 

1) Select the fiat that you want to use
2) Enter the amount of equivalent fiat you want to spend for this transaction
3) Select the type of Stellar token you want to use
4) Click "Calculate Conversion"

The biggest FEAR of using crypto is completed in 4 easy steps. 

Everyone's biggest fear is:
- finding and using the current fiat exchange rate
- finding and using the current rate for any chosen Stellar token
- doing all the needed calculations for ratios and conversions
- using an understandable number of significant figures

Now you can confidently send or receive any type of Stellar token you chose using whatever Stellar wallet you chose, and not have to worry if you made a 
bad calculation or conversion.

Stellar tokens will only reach their full potential if people are comfortably using them as a day to day method of payment.
